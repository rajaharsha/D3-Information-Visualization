# CS725-VI5

* Please review the VI5 accessible at: http://www.cs.odu.edu/~rchinta/CS725-VI5/VI5.html

* This visual implementation 5 is completed using Vega-Lite.js library, to gain some idea since I have not used this library for earlier implementations.

### Links to online resources consulted:

* The below vega-lite online editor is helpful to understand the syntax of multiple graphs under one page.

* Vegalite Tutorials are very helful to gain quick insight of using the library.

### Lessons learned:

* Not all the graphical representrations can be done on any dataset. 

* Selecting a Dataset which fits all the charts, specially Stacked Bar Chart & Heat Map in the assignment is very important. 

* Understood usage of Vega-Lite.js library for Quick and Clean visualizations. But, also understood the scope of customization is very limited.

* Aggregated calculations are made easy in Vega-Lite.

### Comments on which of the idioms was the easiest or most difficult to implement:

* According to me Bar Chars(Both Horizontal, Vertical Charts), Line Chart, Scatter Plots are very easy as they involved one Nominal and one Quantitative values. 

* Heat Map and Stacked Bar Charts requires additional dimention to be visualized, it is a good learning experience.
